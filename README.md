BOOKSTORE WEBSITE

A practice project using React. The final product should contain:

- list of all books avaliable
- option to search for book or author via the search bar
- filter books by genre and region (will add more options potentially)
- sort books by price (high to low and reverse)
- page that lists details for each book
- page that shows a biography of the author, including all of their books available on the website
- cart feature with all the standard functionalities a cart requires
